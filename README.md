NaviCart Final BSc Project

This Android native project was created to enhance, simplify and ease a user's grocery shopping experience.
The application simulates a supermarket's application and allows the user to select the desired products from the list, while also giving the option to save their shopping list for later use.
To handle the data itself, I've built an MSSQL DB to make the querying process faster for my particular use case.
In order to use this system on any computer, Docker must be installed, and a few lines of scripting are required to initiate the database.
